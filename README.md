👋 Hi, I’m Clint Arneson-Hiles
I’m a former heavy equipment operator turned web developer, currently diving deep into full-stack development with a focus on building real-world, user-friendly applications.

👀 I’m passionate about full-stack development, especially projects that involve working with APIs, solving real problems, and delivering clean, responsive UIs. I love exploring both front-end and back-end technologies to understand how everything connects.

🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in JavaScript (including modern libraries like React), Ruby on Rails, and TypeScript. I enjoy building dynamic web apps and I'm always on the lookout for ways to level up—whether that’s through side projects, tutorials, or contributing to open source.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on web development projects—front-end, back-end, or full-stack. Whether you're working on a passion project, a startup idea, or something you just want to bring to life, I’d love to connect and contribute.

📫 Let’s connect on LinkedIn or drop me a message if you’re looking to team up!

⚡ Fun fact: Before I got into coding, I operated massive heavy equipment across industries. Now I build digital tools and apps instead of moving pipe & earth—but the satisfaction of creating something meaningful is the same.
